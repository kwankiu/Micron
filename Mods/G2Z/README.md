The Galileo 2 Z-Drive (G2Z) is designed as a compact Z-drive for the Voron V2 and Micron printers.  It features the same 9:1 planetary gearbox and stepper in an easy-to-assemble package without the need for belts or pulleys (outside of the Z belt and pulley themselves).  This design saves considerable space in the electronics compartment for small V2 printers, as well as the Micron 120 and 180 printers, allowing for more room where it's needed most.
